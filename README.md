Local Library
========
April 2019 - May 2019
------------------

## Express.js library book inventory catalog.

### Overview:
MDN's "Local Library" Express (Node) [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website), in which we develop a website that might be used to manage the catalog for a local library.

- Explored how to set up a server with node.
- Basic structure of an app's file tree.
- Using npm packages and view engines.
- Connecting and interacting with Mongodb.

### State of project:
The project is complete with a few simple upgrades.

### Design decisions:
After completing the Local Library tutorial, I went back over the material and made a second version with my new understanding of how Node/Express/Mongodb worked.

Due to my basic understanding of github at the time, I needed to rebuild the github repository from a local version.  When I rebuilt this repo, I used an Express boilerplate repo I created for future projects in an endeavour to learn best practices on app structure.
